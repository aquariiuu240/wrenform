# wrenform
Javascript library for implimentation of CSS grid and flexbox in a responsive environment. Basically, trying to automate css grid-sizes with a one-size fits all sort of thing. 
Wholly unfinished so don't bother right now :)

Also should be noted this was (at the time of writing) built solely for my usage (feel free to use it as well) meaning that it might be unoptimized and at times unhelpful. I'll try to fix that in the future. 

Currently, in version 0.2.0, way before I plan to release it, it's already pretty helpful for just quickening grid and getting custom grid sizes across the board without too much work.
